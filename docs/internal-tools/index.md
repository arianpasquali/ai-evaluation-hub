## Implementation Approach

### **Hybrid Strategy**
Faktion employs a hybrid approach combining:

- **Third-party tools** for established functionalities (testing, monitoring, UI frameworks)
- **Custom-built solutions** for domain-specific requirements and unique business logic
- **Open-source frameworks** as foundations, extended with custom implementations

### **Key Success Factors**
1. **Data-driven decision making** via carefully defined metrics
2. **Integration of automated and human evaluation** for continuous feedback collection
3. **Continuous experimentation and validation** before full implementation
4. **Cross-functional collaboration** throughout the entire process
5. **Scalable architecture** supporting both rapid prototyping and production deployment
