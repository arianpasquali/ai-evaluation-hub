## Methodology Breakdown

### Task-Driven Development
- **Principle**: Break work into manageable, trackable tasks
- **Implementation**: Use Task Master for hierarchical task management
- **Benefits**: Clear progress tracking, dependency awareness, iterative refinement

### AI-Augmented Planning
- **Principle**: Leverage AI for complexity analysis and task generation
- **Implementation**: Task Master's research-backed analysis
- **Benefits**: More accurate effort estimation, comprehensive task breakdown

### Dependency-First Scheduling
- **Principle**: Prioritize tasks based on dependency completion
- **Implementation**: Task Master's dependency validation and next-task selection
- **Benefits**: Efficient workflow, reduced blocking, logical progression

### Iterative Implementation Logging
- **Principle**: Document implementation journey within task structure
- **Implementation**: Task Master's subtask update mechanism
- **Benefits**: Knowledge retention, pattern recognition, improved future planning

## Integration Points

### MCP Server Integration
- **Purpose**: Seamless tool integration within development environment
- **Implementation**: Task Master MCP server with Cursor/VS Code
- **Benefits**: Direct access to task management without context switching

### CLI Fallback
- **Purpose**: Direct terminal access and automation scripting
- **Implementation**: Global `task-master` command
- **Benefits**: Scriptable workflows, CI/CD integration, power user features

### AI Provider Abstraction
- **Purpose**: Flexible AI service integration
- **Implementation**: Configurable model selection with fallback options
- **Benefits**: Provider independence, cost optimization, feature maximization

## Best Practices

1. **Always start sessions with task overview** (`get_tasks`)
2. **Use complexity analysis before breakdown** (`analyze_project_complexity`)
3. **Maintain dependency integrity** (`validate_dependencies`)
4. **Log implementation progress** (`update_subtask`)
5. **Regular status updates** (`set_task_status`)
6. **Generate documentation after changes** (`generate`)

## Process Flow

```
Initialize → Parse PRD → Analyze Complexity → Expand Tasks → 
Select Next → Implement → Update Progress → Review → 
Test → Document → Deploy → Monitor
```

Each step in this flow is supported by specific tools and follows established methodologies to ensure consistent, efficient development practices.
