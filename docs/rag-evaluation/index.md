# RAG Evaluation Methodology

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems present unique evaluation challenges that require specialized methodologies. Unlike traditional language models or information retrieval systems, RAG combines both retrieval and generation components, creating a complex evaluation landscape that must assess both individual components and their integration.

## What Makes RAG Evaluation Unique

### Dual-Component Architecture
RAG systems consist of two interconnected components that must be evaluated both independently and holistically:

- **Retrieval Component**: Finds relevant information from knowledge sources
- **Generation Component**: Creates responses based on retrieved information
- **Integration Layer**: How well the components work together

### Multi-Dimensional Quality
RAG system quality encompasses multiple dimensions that can sometimes conflict:

- **Retrieval Quality**: Relevance, completeness, and accuracy of retrieved information
- **Generation Quality**: Fluency, coherence, and faithfulness of generated responses
- **Factual Accuracy**: Correctness of information in the final output
- **Source Attribution**: Proper crediting and traceability of information sources
- **Response Relevance**: How well the final answer addresses the user's question

### 🏗️ Three-Layer Evaluation Approach

---

#### **Layer 1: Component Evaluation**
_Assess individual components in isolation to understand their specific contributions and limitations._

**Retrieval Component Metrics**

- **Precision@K**: Proportion of relevant documents in the top-K results
- **Recall@K**: Proportion of relevant documents found in the top-K
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Average reciprocal rank of the first relevant document
- **NDCG**: Measures the quality of ranked retrieval results

**Generation Component Metrics**

- **Fluency**: Natural language quality of generated text
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and consistency of generated content
- **Faithfulness**: Alignment between generated content and source material
- **Completeness**: How fully the generation addresses the input query

---

#### **Layer 2: Integration Evaluation**
_Evaluate how well the retrieval and generation components work together._

**Integration Metrics**

- **Attribution Accuracy**: Correct linking between generated content and sources
- **Information Synthesis**: Quality of combining multiple retrieved sources
- **Relevance Propagation**: How well retrieval relevance translates to generation quality
- **Context Utilization**: Effectiveness of using retrieved context in generation

---

#### **Layer 3: End-to-End Evaluation**
_Assess the complete system from the user's perspective._

**System-Level Metrics**

- **Answer Accuracy**: Correctness of final responses
- **User Satisfaction**: Subjective quality from the user perspective
- **Task Completion**: Success rate for intended use cases
- **Comparative Performance**: Performance relative to alternatives
