# Evaluation-Driven Methodology

## Overview

Faktion's Evaluation-Driven Methodology (EDM) is our systematic approach to developing, deploying, and maintaining generative AI systems. Unlike traditional development approaches that treat evaluation as an afterthought, EDM places evaluation at the center of the entire AI development lifecycle.


## Core Philosophy


**"Evaluation First, Development Second"**

Our methodology is built on the principle that understanding how to measure success is more important than building the system itself. By defining evaluation criteria upfront, we ensure that every AI system we build meets real user needs and business objectives.

## The Evaluation-Driven Development Cycle




### 1. Define Success Criteria
Before writing a single line of code, we establish:

- **Business Objectives**: What business problem are we solving?
- **User Success Metrics**: How will users measure value?
- **Technical Performance Targets**: What are our quality thresholds?
- **Risk Tolerance**: What failures are acceptable vs. unacceptable?

### 2. Design Evaluation Framework
Create a comprehensive evaluation strategy:

- **Evaluation Dimensions**: What aspects will we measure?
- **Metrics Selection**: Which metrics best capture success?
- **Data Requirements**: What data do we need for evaluation?
- **Testing Scenarios**: What use cases must we validate?

### 3. Build Evaluation Infrastructure
Establish the technical foundation:

- **Baseline Measurements**: Current state performance
- **Evaluation Pipelines**: Automated testing workflows
- **Data Collection Systems**: Gathering evaluation data
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Continuous performance tracking

### 4. Iterative Development with Continuous Evaluation
Develop with constant feedback:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iterations with immediate evaluation
- **A/B Testing**: Comparative performance analysis
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Expert review and validation
- **Performance Regression Testing**: Ensure improvements don't break existing functionality

### 5. Production Evaluation & Monitoring
Maintain quality in live systems:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating real user experiences
- **Performance Drift Detection**: Identifying model degradation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular model updates and refinements

## Key Principles

### Principle 1: Measure Everything
Every aspect of AI system performance should be quantifiable and tracked.

- **Input Quality**: Assess the quality of data entering the system
- **Process Performance**: Monitor internal system operations
- **Output Quality**: Evaluate the quality of generated results
- **User Experience**: Track user satisfaction and task completion

### Principle 2: Fail Fast, Learn Faster
Early detection of issues prevents costly downstream problems.

- **Early Warning Systems**: Alert on performance degradation
- **Rapid Iteration Cycles**: Quick feedback loops for improvement
- **Systematic Error Analysis**: Understanding failure modes
- **Proactive Quality Assurance**: Preventing issues before they occur

### Principle 3: Human-AI Collaboration
Combine automated evaluation with human judgment for comprehensive assessment.

- **Expert Review Processes**: Domain expert validation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real user evaluation
- **Adversarial Testing**: Red team evaluation
- **Continuous Human Feedback**: Ongoing human-in-the-loop improvement

### Principle 4: Context-Aware Evaluation
Evaluation criteria must reflect real-world usage contexts.

- **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Tailored evaluation for specific use cases
- **Multi-Stakeholder Perspectives**: Different users, different success criteria
- **Temporal Considerations**: Performance over time
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Evaluation beyond happy path scenarios

## Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning (Week 1-2)

- **Current State Analysis**: Baseline performance measurement
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Define success criteria with all stakeholders
- **Resource Planning**: Allocate evaluation infrastructure resources

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (Week 2-4)

- **Evaluation Pipeline Development**: Automated testing workflows
- **Data Collection Systems**: Gathering and managing evaluation data
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Real-time performance tracking
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure evaluation systems work with development workflows

### Phase 3: Development & Iteration (Ongoing)

- **Feature Development**: Build AI capabilities with continuous evaluation
- **Performance Optimization**: Iterative improvement based on evaluation results
- **Quality Assurance**: Regular validation and testing
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive evaluation records

### Phase 4: Production & Maintenance (Ongoing)

- **Live System Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking in production
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate real-world usage data
- **Model Updates**: Regular improvements based on evaluation insights
- **Performance Reporting**: Regular stakeholder updates on system performance

## Success Metrics for EDM

### Development Efficiency

- **Time to First Evaluation**: How quickly can we assess initial performance?
- **Iteration Cycle Speed**: How fast can we implement and test improvements?
- **Issue Detection Rate**: Percentage of problems caught before production
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Improved code quality through evaluation-driven development

### System Quality

- **Performance Consistency**: Stable performance across different scenarios
- **Error Reduction**: Decreased frequency and severity of system failures
- **User Satisfaction**: Improved user experience and task completion rates
- **Business Impact**: Measurable contribution to business objectives

### Team Effectiveness

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Improved understanding of evaluation practices across teams
- **Decision Confidence**: Data-driven decision making
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and resolution of potential issues
- **Innovation Velocity**: Faster development of new AI capabilities

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Evaluation Overhead

**Problem**: Teams worry that extensive evaluation will slow development.
**Solution**: Start with lightweight evaluation and gradually increase sophistication. Focus on high-impact metrics first.

### Challenge 2: Metric Selection

**Problem**: Choosing the right metrics for complex AI systems is difficult.
**Solution**: Use our established [Quality Metrics](../principles/quality-metrics.md) framework and adapt for specific use cases.

### Challenge 3: Data Requirements

**Problem**: Evaluation requires significant amounts of high-quality data.
**Solution**: Implement synthetic data generation and active learning approaches. See our [Data Collection](../tools/data-collection.md) guide.

### Challenge 4: Stakeholder Alignment

**Problem**: Different stakeholders have different definitions of success.
**Solution**: Use our multi-stakeholder evaluation framework to balance competing priorities.
