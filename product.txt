Problem Statement
Faktion's internal knowledge about generative AI evaluation methodologies and best practices is currently scattered across various documents, Slack conversations, and individual team member expertise. This creates knowledge silos, inconsistent evaluation approaches across projects, and onboarding challenges for new team members. Without centralized, accessible documentation, teams struggle to:

Apply consistent evaluation standards across AI projects
Learn from past evaluation experiences and methodologies
Onboard new employees efficiently on AI evaluation practices
Share best practices between departments (developers, AI engineers, sales, product managers)

Solution Overview
Build an internal documentation website that automatically bootstraps content from Faktion's existing knowledge base, focusing specifically on generative AI evaluation methodologies and best practices. The platform will serve as the single source of truth for internal processes, making institutional knowledge accessible to all employees while maintaining up-to-date, searchable, and well-organized content.

The documentation is based on mkdocs-material. All we need to do is to generate documentation insider `docs` directory.
We do have out knowledge base under directory `knowledge-base`.
